user_description: |- 
  My name is Jacqueline and I’m currently a computer science student at the University of Waterloo. I’m passionate about software development, learning new things, and bringing people together.

  At my previous engineering internships, I’ve helped develop 1100+ microservices to automate accountant and book-keeper tasks using Javascript, HTTP, and networking. I’ve also created websites that have attracted over $50,000 in cancer research funding. Being able to make impact and ultimately help people is what drives my work. 
  
  Outside of work, I'm passionate about connecting with people through art, music, and food! I enjoy experimenting with different art mediums, discovering new music, and trying new cuisines. If you'd like to chat with me, please feel free to send a message!

  "Jacqueline is a solid developer and unflaggingly positive. She demonstrates a strong interest in the work and a perseverance to solve difficult problems; even pulling other people's solutions to problems that stymied her to investigate how they were solved. 
  She maintained excellent communication when working on more complex fixes, asked thoughtful questions and provided insightful input during team OKRs. 
  
  Jacqueline, through asking thoughtful questions and acting as spokesperson for the team demonstrated the seeds of good communication and leadership skills. She was a pleasure to work with throughout the term."

  "Jacqueline has an excellent work ethic and continuously exceeded our expectations in the difficulty of the work she was able to successfully complete. She contributed to our most important projects and consistently completed her work ahead of schedule. 

  She also displayed enthusiasm for work that is beyond her job requirements, pro-actively seeking new tasks and responsibilities. Jacqueline would be a positive addition to any of her future endeavours. Thank you for all the great work, Jacqueline."
