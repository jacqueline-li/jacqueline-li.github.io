user_description: |- 
  Hi, my name is Jacqueline and I’m currently a computer science student at the University of Waterloo. I’m passionate about software development, learning new things, and bringing people together.

  At my previous engineering internships, I’ve helped develop 800+ microservices to automate accountant and book-keeper tasks using Javascript libraries. I’ve also created websites that have attracted over $50,000 in cancer research funding. Being able to make impact and ultimately help people is what drives my work. 
  
  I’m currently looking for SWE or PM internship opportunities for Fall/Winter 2020. 
  If you know of any cool opportunities or would like to chat, please shoot me a message!
