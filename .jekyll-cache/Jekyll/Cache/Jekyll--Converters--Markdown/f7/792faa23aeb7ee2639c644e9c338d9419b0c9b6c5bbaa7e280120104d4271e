I"Ø<p>My name is Jacqueline and Iâ€™m currently a computer science student at the University of Waterloo. Iâ€™m passionate about software development, learning new things, and bringing people together.</p>

<p>At my previous internships, Iâ€™ve helped develop 800+ microservices to automate accountant and book-keeper tasks using Javascript libraries and created websites which attracted over $50000 in cancer research funding using ReactJS. Being able to help people and ultimately make things better is what drives me as a software developer.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m currently looking for SWE or PM internship opportunities for Fall/Winter 2020. 
If you know of any cool opportunities or would like to chat, please shoot me a message!</p>
